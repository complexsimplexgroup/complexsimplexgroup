- 👋 Hi!  We are @complexsimplexgroup, a research group in complex systems.
- 👀 We are mainly interested in complex systems and theoretical physics, chemistry, and biology.
- 🌱 To this aim we carry out numerical simulations of the systems that we study.
- 💞️ For our numerical works we mainly use julia, but we regularly resort to other languages such as python and C.
- 📫 For any questions or requests of information, please feel free to write to:  complex.simplex.group@gmail.com
